# fp_masterquiz

version 0.3.5

TYPO3 extension to create a quiz or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

It is the official successor extension of myquizpoll.
Currently it is only a beta release. Please give me feedback.
This extension is not backward compatible to myquizpoll!

Features: a quiz or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.

You find the documentation at typo3.org: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/fp_masterquiz/

Last feature: show all answers.
