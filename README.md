# fp_masterquiz

version 0.4.5

TYPO3 extension to create a quiz, poll or test. The participant result will be saved in the DB too and can be deleted automatically via Scheduler.

Currently it is only a beta release. Please give me feedback.
This extension is not backward compatible to myquizpoll, but there is a simple import-task for myquizpoll-questions.

Features: a quiz, poll or test can be played by submitting a form or by submitting an AJAX-request.

You find the documentation at typo3.org: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/fp_masterquiz/

Last feature: backend module.
